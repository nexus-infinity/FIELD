archetype:
  atlas:   { meaning: "Standing-wave corridor (constant band)", glyph: "▲" }
  tata:    { meaning: "Daily heartbeat (showers as truth)",     glyph: "▼" }
  obiwan:  { meaning: "Observer of the banal constant",          glyph: "●" }
  dojo:    { meaning: "Practice in liminality (earth↔sky)",      glyph: "◼︎" }
intent:
  interstellar: "Use constant band as carrier for handshake."
  ancient:      "Water-pulse broadcast of memory; repeatable rite."
  operational:  "Train field to detect invariants inside variability."
constraints:
  invariance: "Band must remain within 10–16°C semantics."
  rhythm:     "Pulse recorded daily as presence/absence of rain."
